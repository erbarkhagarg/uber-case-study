This is about the Demand-Supply gap issue being faced by the Uber Taxi service and finding solution for the same<br>
During certain times in a day, Uber observes lot of riders cancelling their rides while a lot of customers looking for a ride but the requests are not fulfilled due to unavailabilty of cabs<br>
So a detailed analysis of the data was done using various visualizations that reveals what time of the day does this Demand-Supply gap reach its peak, from which pickup and drop points (City/Airport) and what are the reasons behind this<br>
Based on this analysis, recommendations were made so that this Demand Supply gap can be reduced and maximum customer satisfaction is attained
